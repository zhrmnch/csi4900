                        "General Language" in phishing emails refers to vague or non-specific language used to target a broad audience, without knowing specific details about individual recipients. For example, an email that starts with "Dear valued customer" or uses vague language like "Your account has been compromised" may be a phishing attempt.

                    <input type="checkbox" name="general-language" id="general-language" value="true">

                        "Spelling/Grammatical Errors" in phishing emails refer to emails that contain obvious spelling, punctuation or grammatical errors. Such errors may signal that the email is a phishing attempt, as attackers may not be as concerned with proper grammar and spelling as legitimate organizations. For example, an email that says "Your accuont has been temporarly locked" may be a phishing attempt.
                    </span>
                    <input type="checkbox" name="spelling-grammatical-errors" id="spelling-grammatical-errors" value="true">

                        "Spoofed Email Sender" in phishing emails refers to the practice of disguising the true origin of an email by altering the sender information. Attackers can use this tactic to make an email appear as if it comes from a trusted source, such as a bank or a well-known company, in order to trick the recipient into disclosing sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link. For example, an email that appears to be from a bank but has a sender address that does not match the bank's official domain may be a phishing attempt.
                    </span>
                    <input type="checkbox" name="spoofed-email-sender" id="spoofed-email-sender" value="true">
                    <label for="spoofed-email-sender">Spoofed Email Sender</label>

                <div class="hover-text">
                    <span class="tooltip-text" id="right">
                        "Urgent Language" in phishing emails refers to the use of language designed to create a sense of urgency or importance in the recipient, in order to prompt them to take immediate action without thinking. This tactic is often used to pressure the recipient into clicking on a link or providing sensitive information, by making them believe that failing to act quickly will have negative consequences. For example, an email that says "Your account will be closed if you do not update your information immediately" may be a phishing attempt.
                    </span>
                    <input type="checkbox" name="urgent-language" id="urgent-language" value="true">
                    <label for="urgent-language">Urgent Language</label>

                    <span class="tooltip-text" id="right">
                        "Wrong Redirect" in phishing emails refers to the practice of redirecting the recipient to a different website than the one they were expecting to visit. This tactic is often used to redirect the recipient to a fake website that looks similar to a legitimate one, in order to trick them into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. For example, an email that contains a link to a legitimate banking website but redirects to a fake website designed to steal login credentials may be a phishing attempt.
                    </span>
                    <input type="checkbox" name="wrong-redirect" id="wrong-redirect" value="true">
                    <label for="wrong-redirect">Wrong Redirect</label>
